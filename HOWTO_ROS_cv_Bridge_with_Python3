Dependencies
We’ll first download the python build tools:

$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python-catkin-tools python3-dev python3-numpy
$ sudo pip3 install rospkg catkin_pkg

Workspace
Next, create a separate workspace to compile the bridge_cv ROS package. We would be naming the directory cvbridge_build_ws.

$ mkdir -p ~/cvbridge_build_ws/src
$ cd ~/cvbridge_build_ws/src
After the workspace has been setup, we’ll clone the open_vision repository into ~/cvbridge_build_ws/src:

$ git clone -b noetic https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.git


Open CMakeLists.txt with you favorite text editor and make the following modification at Line 11, changing:

find_package(Boost REQUIRED python37)
to

find_package(Boost REQUIRED python3)

Compilation
$ cd ~/cvbridge_build_ws
$ catkin config -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.6m -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
$ catkin config --install
$ catkin build cv_bridge

if error occurs here,
don't catkin config and try:

$ catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3


Source your .sh files
$ source devel/setup.bash


To make sure your workspace is properly overlayed by the setup script, make sure ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable includes the directory you're in.
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
